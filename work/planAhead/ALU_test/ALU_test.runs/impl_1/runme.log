Updating timing models...
WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

WARNING:Par:468 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
   Route Static Timing Report"). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

   Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -> Design Goals & Strategies) to ensure the best options
   are set in the tools for timing closure.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go to
   either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or "
   TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
